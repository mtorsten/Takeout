# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A Python command-line tool that processes Google Photos export data to update file timestamps based on metadata. The tool reads supplemental metadata files containing photoTakenTime information and applies these timestamps to the corresponding media files, ensuring accurate file creation and modification dates.

## Glossary

- **Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater**: The Python command-line application that processes Google Photos metadata
- **Metadata_File**: JSON files with ".supplemental-metadata.json" suffix containing photo metadata
- **Media_File**: The actual photo or video file referenced by the metadata file
- **photoTakenTime**: Timestamp field in metadata indicating when the photo was originally taken
- **File_System**: The operating system's file management system that stores timestamp information

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with Google Photos export data, I want to provide a folder path as a command-line parameter, so that the tool can process all my photos in that location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the program without a folder path parameter, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL exit with an error message
2. WHEN the user provides a valid folder path parameter, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL verify the path exists and is accessible
3. WHEN the user provides an invalid or non-existent folder path, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL exit with an appropriate error message
4. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL verify read access to the specified folder before processing
5. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL verify write access to test file timestamp modification capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with nested photo folders, I want the tool to scan all subfolders recursively, so that all my photos are processed regardless of their folder structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL recursively traverse all subdirectories within the specified folder path
2. WHEN scanning directories, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL identify all files ending with ".supplemental-metadata.json"
3. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL process metadata files found at any depth within the folder structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user wanting accurate file timestamps, I want the tool to read photoTakenTime from metadata files, so that my media files reflect when photos were actually taken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a metadata file, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL parse the JSON content successfully
2. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL extract the photoTakenTime timestamp value from the metadata
3. WHEN photoTakenTime is missing or invalid, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL log an error and continue processing other files
4. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL convert the timestamp to the appropriate format for file system operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with media files, I want the tool to update both creation and modification timestamps, so that file properties accurately reflect when photos were taken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL determine the corresponding media file name by removing the ".supplemental-metadata.json" suffix
2. WHEN the corresponding media file exists, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL update both creation time and modification time
3. WHEN the corresponding media file does not exist, THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL log a warning and continue processing
4. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL handle file system permission errors gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user processing large photo collections, I want to see progress and error information, so that I can monitor the tool's operation and identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL display progress information during processing
2. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL log successful timestamp updates
3. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL log errors and warnings with descriptive messages
4. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL provide a summary of processed files upon completion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user wanting comprehensive logging, I want all operations and errors written to a log file, so that I can review detailed information about the processing results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL create a log file to record all operations and errors
2. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL log access denied errors when unable to read or modify files
3. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL log cases where metadata files exist but corresponding media files cannot be found
4. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL log all media files found that do not have corresponding metadata files
5. THE Google_Photos_Timestamp_Updater SHALL include timestamps in all log entries for traceability
